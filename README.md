# story_game_prototype

This is a prototype game project used for implementing story-based game mechanics from scratch. This will be used as a base for a full game.

Project goals:
- Implement a flexible character dialogue system from scratch (COMPLETE)
- Implement room/level transitions (COMPLETE)
- Implement player character with movement and interaction mechanics (COMPLETE)
- Implement save/load and full game-state consistency (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

To-do:
- Craft a story that can be supported by the mechanics
- Create multiple levels
- Create more interactable entities that progress dialogue/story (i.e. characters, objects, locations)
